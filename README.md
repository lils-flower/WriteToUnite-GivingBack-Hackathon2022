# WritetoUnite's Giving Hack (Back)
This repository hosts the coding project I created for the WritetoUnite's Giving Hack (Back) 2022 social good hackathon. 
As a participant, the aim was to design web features for nonprofits within 48 hours. 
## Architecture of the website
The website is built on [Repl.it](https://replit.com/) using the coding languages HTML, CSS and JavaScript. 
If you visit the website, you will find a lot of different features implemented, such as a slideshow carrousel which should host testimonials, youtube videos regarding different nonprofits.
If you hover on some pictures, you will find explainations to them. Also, you have a study space with a spotify playlist implemented.
